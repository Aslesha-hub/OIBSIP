Task 5: Social Engineering Attacks Research Report
Overview
I have been researching how human psychology is often the weakest link in cybersecurity. While we often focus on firewalls and code, social engineering is a technique where attackers manipulate individuals into giving up confidential information. This report explores common methods and how we can protect ourselves.

Common Social Engineering Techniques
Through my research, I have identified three primary methods used by attackers:
1.Phishing: This is the most common attack I found. Attackers send deceptive emails that look official to trick users into clicking malicious links or sharing login credentials.
2.Pretexting: In this scenario, the attacker creates a fabricated story (a pretext) to gain the victim’s trust. For example, they might pretend to be from the HR department needing to "verify" your bank details.
3.Baiting: This involves a physical or digital. An attacker might leave a malware-infected USB drive in a public place, hoping a curious person will plug it into their computer.

Real-World Impact & Case Studies
One significant case was the 2020 Twitter hack. The attackers didn't use a software; instead, they used phone-based social engineering to trick employees into giving up internal tool access. This shows that even the biggest tech companies are vulnerable if their staff isn't properly trained.

My Recommendations for Prevention
Based on the threats identified, I believe organizations should follow these steps to stay safe:
1.Security Awareness Training: We must teach people to stay skeptical of "urgent" requests for information.
2.Verify via Different Channels: If you get a suspicious email from a boss, call them or message them on a different platform to confirm it’s really them.
3.Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): This is a critical safety net. Even if an attacker steals a password through phishing, they still cannot access the account without the second code.
