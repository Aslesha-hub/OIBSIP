Task 4: Research Report on Common Network Security Threats

Introduction

I have analyzed several critical network threats that organizations face today. Understanding these "invisible" dangers is the first step in building a strong defense system.

1. Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks

How it works: An attacker sends so much fake traffic to a website or server that it crashes or becomes too slow to use.

Impact: Real customers cannot access the service, which can cause a business to lose money and trust.

Mitigation: Using specialized firewalls (WAF) or "traffic scrubbing" services that can tell the difference between a real user and a bot.

2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks
   
How it works: The attacker "eavesdrops" on a conversation between two people (or two computers). They sit in the middle and steal data like passwords or credit card numbers without anyone knowing.

Impact: Private data is stolen or even changed before it reaches the destination.

Mitigation: Always using encryption like HTTPS and being very careful when using public Wi-Fi in places like coffee shops.

3. Spoofing
   
How it works: This is like a "digital mask." The attacker pretends to be a trusted source—like a fake email address or a fake IP address—to gain access to a network.

Impact: It allows hackers to bypass security checks by pretending to be "one of the good guys."

Mitigation: Implementing strong authentication protocols and verifying the source of all incoming data packets.

Real-World Example

The GitHub DDoS attack in 2018 is a famous example. Hackers used a massive amount of traffic to knock GitHub offline for several minutes. This shows that even the strongest platforms must be prepared for these types of network-level threats.

Conclusion

Network security is a constant battle. By understanding how DoS, MITM, and Spoofing work, we can implement better firewalls and encryption to keep our digital environments safe.
